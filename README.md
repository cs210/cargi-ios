Many tools in our lives are personalized, and we should expect the same things from our cars, considering the amount of time we spend in them. Drivers have varying skills and habits: some might prefer a safe driver mode which allows them to easily switch lanes, guides them into a parking spot, and finds roads where there are fewer cars.  Others might want the radio blasting and mood lighting as they speed down the highway, or want to automatically play their favorite morning radio show on their way to work. Weâ€™re really excited to make the car experience something that is more than just about getting from one place to another - the car should feel like an extension of yourself where everything is customized to perfectly meet your needs.

# Getting started:
To run the iOS app, you must import the GoogleMaps framework, which is stored in our Google Drive `6 - Software Demo` due to its large size. Place the GoogleMaps.framework file in `iOS > CargiApp > Pods > GoogleMaps > Frameworks`.

**Important**: Do not use `.xcodeproject` file to open Xcode; use `iOS > CargiApp > CargiApp.xcworkspace` instead.

# Development Workflow:
1. For every feature or bug fix needed on the Cargi app, open up an issue first.
2. Assign yourself, or another team member to the issue, with proper labels (high/low priority, etc).
3. When done with an issue, commit and push your code, and close the issue. Remember to `git pull` first to get the current changes.

#### Note regarding branches
- When working on a feature that is still in the development phase, *always* work on the `dev` branch.
- If the feature is fully-working, push to the `master` branch.
- If the feature has been thoroughly tested and is ready for deployment, push to the `deploy` branch.

### Other APIs/SDKs
- Maya built an API for finding cheap gas: https://github.com/mayanb/gaspriceapi
- Nuance SpeechKit for speech recognition and text-to-speech
